# JavaScript-Quiz
> A timed JavaScript Quiz that stores high scores

This quiz site uses DOM elements, timing elements, localstorage, and basic javascript knowledge to create a page that updates dynamically, stores data for return visits to the page, and udpates based on correct/incorrect inputs from the user.

## Process / What I learned

This project, I started pseudocoding just the basic DOM elements and how to grab them and then how to append them later. I basically built it one part at a time and styled it at the very end. The localstorage gave me trouble for a while but after many iterations I was able to figure out what I had wrong. There are a few things that could still be improved but overall it works mostly as intended.
